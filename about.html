    <span class = "aps">APS</span> Classes is an offline coaching institute based in Delhi, committed to delivering focused and disciplined education for school students. We offer complete academic support for Classes 1 to 10 (all subjects), along with preparation for school exams, board exams, and the Sainik School Entrance Examination.

For senior students, APS Classes provides specialized coaching for Classes 11 and 12 in Polity and History, designed to build strong conceptual understanding and exam-oriented writing skills.

All classes are conducted by an Master's-qualified faculty, ensuring clarity in teaching, personal attention, and consistent academic monitoring. We believe in structured learning, regular practice, and accountability—because results don’t come from shortcuts.

Guided by our motto, “Target on the Eye, Eye on the Target,” we train students to stay focused, disciplined, and goal-oriented throughout their academic journey.
